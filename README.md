# The Blood Tree - A Ludum Dare 51 game

This game and its initial version has been developped during the 48 hour game creation competition Ludum Dare 51 in the weekend of 1 oct 2022.

Theme: Every 10 seconds

## Game play

You're a tree annoyed of humans picking its fruits that learned the taste of blood. And you subsequently turned into a tree that craves humans every 10 seconds.

Spread your roots from the main tree and decide what sprouts from your roots. You can create:
- lure: to attract and trap humans
- blockade: block the route
- offensive: shoots acid towards anything

Trapping will alert other humans in the area. To survive make sure to separate the humans first through blockades and other lures.
